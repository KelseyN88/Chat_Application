# Chat Application Project - Upright Education

This project is a chat room application in which a user can signup for an account or login to an existing one.
There are rooms where the user can enter and write messages. The user may also create their own room or edit one
theyve created previously. If the room was not created by that owner then they cannot make edits or delete the room.

Users can see messages created by other users. And hop in and out of Rooms.
